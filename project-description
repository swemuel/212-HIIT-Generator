Web application that assists you in creating a HIIT (high intensity interval training) workout.

  Variables
    length (10 min, 20 min, 30 min) or (10 min, 15 min, 20 min)
    muscle group you want to target (legs, upper body, full body, abs) or (glutes, arms, quads, hammys, chest, back, shoulders)
    difficulty (determined by rest time/including or not including certain exercises)


    each exercise/rest section will be 1 minute (hard = 45s on 15s rest, intermediate = 40s on 20s off, beginner = 30s on 30s off)
    10 min workout = 2 sets of 5 exercises
    15 min workout = 2 sets of 7 exercises with 1 min break in between
    20 min workout = 2 sets of 9 exercises with 2 minute rest in between or 3 of 6 with 1 min rest
    30 min workout = 3 sets of 8 workouts with 2 minute rest in between

  Functionality
    click on length
    check muscle group (maybe in order of priority)
    click on difficulty

      if legs selected and if length = 10min
        randomly select 1 glute exercise
        randomly select 1 quad exercises
        randomly select 1 hammy exercises
        randomly select 2 jumping exercises

      if legs selected and if length = 15min
        randomly select 2 glute exercise
        randomly select 2 quad exercises
        randomly select 1 hammy exercises
        randomly select 2 jumping exercises

        if legs selected and if length = 20min
          randomly select 2 glute exercise
          randomly select 2 quad exercises
          randomly select 1 hammy exercises
          randomly select 1 calf exercise
          randomly select 2 jumping exercises
          randomly select 1 leg exercise

      once the workout comes up (on a new page), user can then hit a refresh button next to a certain exercise to cycle
      through to another random exercise in that category. Or they can search/chose one they would like to replace it with

      they can also change the difficulty which would change the amount of rest per minute.
